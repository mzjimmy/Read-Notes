页岩气是指困在页岩中的天然气。

美国有丰富的页岩资源，开采其中的天然气能带来丰富的经济效益。

然而，开采时需要大量的水，可能会产生环境问题。大量用水可能会影响其他方面的用水。废水处理的方法也有很大问题。若处理不当，可能会影响附近水源和自然栖息地。

Shale gas is natural gas trapped in rocks. According to the EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2011, the U. S. possesses plenty of shale gas resources. If the resources can be fully employed, it would bring substantial economic benefits.

However, the drilling and fracturing of wells requires lots of water, which may cause some environmental problems.

Significant use of water may affect the use of water in other aspects. The treatment of wastewater is also a big problem. If not handled properly, it could affect sources of drinking water and natural habitats.
