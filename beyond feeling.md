#《Beyond feelings》

##01 who you are 

(you do not choose to be yourself)

The impact of the world on all of us is much greater than we usually realize.

（种族、宗教、国际、经济水平等等，太多因素会**`影响`**我们的自我定位。Identity.）

The circumstances of our lives are so influential that they affect not only our view of the owrld but also our view of ourselves.

（环境因素不仅影响了我们的世界观，更影响了我们对自己的定位。）

**self image.**

They believed they were stupid, so they acted that way.

The educator set out to change their self-images.He found that when he accomplished that,they no longer behaved stupidly！

（自我认知会影响行为）

###Becoming an individual  独立思考

(不做巴甫洛夫的狗。）

These guidelines will help you achieve individuality:

1. Tree your first reaction to any person,issue,or situation as tentative. No matter how appealing it may be, refuse to embrave it until after you have examined it.

	（暂时放置你对任何人或事的第一看法，不管那个看法多诱人，在你检查它之前，拒绝接受。）

2. Decide why you reacted as you did. Consider whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else-a parent or friend, perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way.

	（想想你为什么有这种想法。想想这个想法是否是从别人那里传过来的。如果可以的话，想想是什么具体的经验让你有那样的反应。）

3. Think of other reactions your might have had to the person, issue, or situation.

	（想想别的角度，对于同一个人或一件事，能否有不同的看法。）
4. Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than your first reaction. And when you answer, resist the influence of your conditioning.
	
	（思考另一种想法是否比最初的反应更适合。回答的时候，不要受环境的影响。）

To ensure that you will really be an individual, and not merely claim to be one, apply these guidelines throughout your work in this book, as well as in your everyday life.

##02 what is critical thinking

(How to think?What is thinking?)

Embarrased and not knowing quite what to do ,he looked down at his desk.

So he stared at the ceiling.

No one ever explained what thinking is .

###critical thinking defined

One of the keys to proficiency in critical thinking is skill in `asking relevant questions`.Where the uncritical accept their first thoughts and others' statements at face value, critical thinkers challenge all ideas in the following manner.

(有批判性头脑的人，不会第一时间就接受所有的想法和价值观，他们会检查，会思考。）

Here are some of the questions a critical thinker would ask:

- what is the relationship between values and beliefs?Between values and convictions?
- Are all values valuable?
- How aware is the average person of his or her values?Is it possible that many people deceive themselves about their real values?
- Where do one's values originate?Within the individual or outside?In thought or in feeling?
- Does education change a person's values? If so, is this change always for the better?
- Should parents and teachers attempt to shape children's values?

###Characteristics of critical thinkers

There are a number of misconceptions about critical thinking.

One is that being able to support beliefs with reasons makes one a critical thinker.Virtually everyone has reasons, however pathetic they may be.The test of critical thinking is whether the reasons are good and sufficient.

(批判性思维不是说会找理由，而是说找到的理由好且足够。)

Another misconception is that critical thinkers never imitate others in thought or action. 

Crtitical thinking means making wise decisions, regardless of how common those decisions are.

(批判性思维不是特立独行，而是谁有道理听谁的，不管那个道理多普通。）

A third misconception is that critical thinking is synonymous with having a lot of right answers in one's head.

Critical thinking is `the process` of finding answers when they are not so readily available.


(批判性思维,不代表有着现成的正确答案，而在于思考的过程,即使不愿意。)

Yet another misconception is that critical thinking cannot be learned, that one either "has it" or does not.On the contrary, critical thinking is a matter of habit.

（批判性思维可以习得，它不是一种天赋。)

Asking appropriate questions.（是批判性思维者的一个特点）


**独立思考者的特质**

Here are some additional characteristics of critical thinkers , as contrasted with those of uncritical thinkers:

- Critical Thinkers:

Are honest with thenselves, acknowledging what they don't know, recognizing their limitations, and being watchful of their own errors.

（对自己诚实，知之为知之不知为不知。看得到自己的错误。）

- Uncritical thinkers:

Pretend they know more than they do, ignore their limitations, and assume their views are error-free.

- Critical Thinkers:

regard problems and controversial issues as exciting challenges.

将问题和矛盾看成刺激的挑战。

- uncritical thinkers:

regard problems and controversial issues as nuisances or threats to their ego.

- critical thinkers:

strive for understanding, keep curiosity alive, remain patient with complexity and ready to invest time to overcome confusion.

保持好奇心，对复杂性保持耐心，愿意花时间解决困惑。

- uncritical thinkers:

are impatient with complexity and thus would rather remain confused than make the effort to understand.

- critical thinkers:

set aside personal preferences and base judgments on evidence, deferring judgment whenever evidence is insufficient.They revise judgments when new evidence reveal error.

抛开个人偏见和喜好，只依赖证据做判断。新的证据出现时，他们愿意修正错误

- uncritical thinkers:

base judgments on first impressions and gut reactions. They are unconcerned about the amount or quality of evidence and cling to earlier views steadfastly.

- critical thinkers:

are interested in other people's ideas, so are willing to read and listen attentively, even when they tend to disagree with the other person.

- uncritical thinkers:


are preoccupied with self and their own opinions, and so are unwilling to pay attention to other's views. At the first sign of disagreement they tend to think,"How can I refute this?"

- critical thinkers:

recognize that extreme views(whether conservative or liberal)are seldom correct, so they avoid them, practice fair-mindedness, and seek a balanced view.

- uncritical thinkers:

ignore the need for balance and give preference to views that support their established views.

- critical thinkers:

practice restraint, controlling their feelings rather than being controlled by them, and thinking before acting.

- uncritical thinkers:

tend to follow their feelings and act impulsively.

（独立思考者控制自己的想法，而不是被想法控制。）

##03 What is Truth

(What is Truth?)

Those who acceptedf the existence of this truth believed it was a spiritual reality, not a physical one.That is, it was not a celestial ledger or file-drawer- yet it was beyond time and space.

（真理是超越空间和时间的存在?）

Now, it seldom concerns Truth anymore, most people seem to doubt its existence.And even if it does exist, they reason, it's of little help to us in our world and our lives because it is beyond human understanding.

（真理即使存在，也不是人能感知的，它超出了人的理解范围。）

What we see is shaped by our individual way of seeing. We focus on what interests us. We filter out of our perception what seems unimportant to us. So each of us perceives the word around him,and the events that fill this life, in a unique way. No two people see the same event precisely alike.

（我们看到的世界，取决于自己的主观输入。)

Truth is relative;that is ,that it varies from person to person, that one person's truth is another's error, and that there is not higher claim to validity than individual viewpoint.

（真相随人而异）

###The quality of perception

**First, we can be mistaken in what we perceive.**

(听到别人的笑声，一个路过的男生可能觉得是在嘲笑自己而动手）

（大学生考试时，总选的是自己觉得正确的答案，但结果往往不是。）

###The quality of information

**Second, our information can be inaccurate or incomplete.

**

（北半球的水流是逆时针旋转，而南半球是顺时针旋转的，即使你亲眼所见，也不见得是所有真相。）

###Even the wise can error

All too often, what is taken as truth today by the mose respected minds is proved erroneous tomorrow.

（曾经的地球中心论）

(曾经的真理现在却是谬误，很多真理受时代的局限。）



> A good way to begin is to keep the following thought in mind:"I know I've got limitations and can easily be mistaken. And surely I'll never find all the answers I'd like to. But I can observe a little more accurately, weigh things a little more thoroughly, and make up my mind a little more carefully. If I do so, I'll be a little closer to the truth."

（真理不是多样的，虽然我们无法揭示它的全部面目，却可以一步步靠近它，这样就够了。）


##04 What doese it mean to KNOW

(拼embarras）

Marie knew the answer, but she was wrong.Nancy didn't know, but she was right.

（知道的人错了，而不确定的人反而对了。说明我们对自以为知晓的事情，往往掌握地有偏差。）


To know means not only to have the correct answer but to be aware that we have it.（知其然，知其所以然）

###Active and passive knowing

We achieve it actively by direct experience, by testing and proving an idea(as in a scientivfic experiment), or by reasoning.

We achieve knowledge passively by being told by someone else.

（我们的大部分知识，是被动接受的）

Unfortunately, passive learning has a serious defect. It makes us tend to accept uncritically what we are told.

（信息在传递的途中，往往会发生变形。）

Most people listen imperfectly.And many enjoy adding their own creative touch to a story, trying to improve on it, stamping it with their own personal style.

Yet the effect is the same in either case-those who hear it think they know.

（他们以为自己理解的信息是正确的。）

###The impossibility of perfect knowledge

（信息在传递的过程中，很难保持不变。）

(隔代遗忘，需要重新学习。）

Even when your evidence is solid, it may be incomplete.（因此我们更要注重证据，多次检查想法的正确性。）

There is no shame in admitting we do not know something - in saying "I think" or "It seems to me." To make that admission when it is appropriate shows good sense, restraint, and intellectual honesty. **These are not intellectual weaknesses, but strengths.**

（承认自己无知，不是脆弱，而是勇气。）

##05 How good are your option

(个人偏好，无可指责）

personal preference.

(个人偏好，不能代表事实。想法不等于事实，但总有人混淆它们。）

Yet however deeply and sincerely such opinions are held, the are wrong.

（无论想法多么根深蒂固，但那可能是错的，不是事实。）

（多种颜色的咖啡，除了颜色没有任何不同，但有人却被颜色影响，认为红色更能提神！）

The people had been subconsciously influenced by the color of the label!

###Kinds of error

There are four general kinds of error that can corrupt anyone's opinions.Francis Bacon classified them as follows:

1. errors or tendencies to error common among all people by virtue of their being human;
2. errors that come from human communication and the limitations of language;
3. errors in the general fashion or attitude of an age;
4. errors posed to an individual by a particualr situation

Some people are more prone to errors than others.John Locke described them as follows:(容易犯思维错误的几种人）

- Those who seldom reason at all, but think and act as those around them do -parents, neighbors, the clergy, or anyone else they admire and respect. Such people want to avoid the difficulty that accompanies thinking of themselves.
- Those who are determined to let passion rather than reason govern their lives. Those people are influenced only by reasoning that supports their prejudices.
- Those who sincerely follow reason, but lack sound, overall good sense, and so do not look at all sides of an issue. They tend to talk with one type of person, read one type of book, and so are  exposed to only one viewpoint.

还应该加上一种：

people who never bother to reexamine an opinion once it has been formed.(从来不重新检查已形成的观念的人）

###Forming sound opinions

It's natural for us to form opinions. One of the things that makes human beings vastly more complex and interesting than trees or cows is their ability to form opinions.

（是人，就会有自己的观点，这没什么特别的，关键是，他们的观点可能扭曲了事实，是错误的。）

（这种能力可能让我们有智慧，也可能让我们陷入荒谬。）

Here are three helpful tips to ensure that your opinions will be sound:

1. Base your opinions on careful observation rather than on habit or impulse. In particular, use your critical thinking skills in forming them.（认真观察，得出意见，不要想当然。）
2. From time to time, reexamine old opinions in the light of new knowledge.If you find that an opinion is no longer reasonable, modify it accordingly. （如果发现自己的想法是错误的，抛弃它。）
3. Do not mistake familiarty for soundness.Once you've formed an opinion, it's bound to seem solid to you-the very act of forming it shapes it to your outlook. The test to apply is not how comfortable you feel having the opinion but how well it fits the reality it is supposed to represent.（不要将偏好当做意见，想法不代表事实。）

(原文分的不清楚。）

##06 The basic problem--Mine is better

It's natural enough to like our own possessions better than other people's possessions.

They are saying something about themselves:"Hey, look at me. I'm something special."

(比较）

> Mine is better。

Most wars, for example, can be traced to some form of "mine is better" thinking.

For many people, most of the time, the "mine is better" tendency is balanced by the awareness that other people feel the same way about their things, that it's an unavoidable part of being a person to do so.

（想当然觉得，别人会和我们有一样的感受。）

###ethnocentric people (有优越感的人）

The problem is that some people do not understand that each person has a special viewpoint.

"ethnocentric"people, people who believe strongly that their race, their religion, their culture, or their value system is superior to all others.

Ethnocentric people, of course, are not born but made.

(和父母的教育有关，和童年的经历有关）

###Controlling "Mine is better" thinking

There are two helpful ways to control "mine is better thinking.

The first is to remember that, like everyone else, we are prone to it and that its influence will be strongest when the subject is one that we really care about.

As G.K.Chesterton observed,

> We are exact and scientific on the subjects we do not care about. 

(我们对自己偏好的事物会不经审视，却会仔细研究我们反对的东西。）

The second way to control "mine is better" thinking is to be alert for signals of its presence. Those signals can be found both in our feelings and in our thoughts:

**In feelings:**very pleasant, favorable sensations, the desire to embrace a statement or a argument immediately , withou appraising it further. Or very unpleasant, negative sensations, the desire to attack and denounce a statement or argument without delay.

**In thoughts:** Ideas such as "I'm glad that experts are taking such a position - I've thought it all along" No use wasting time anslyzing this evidence - it must be conclusive." Or ideas such as "This view is outrageous because it challenges what I have always thought - I refuse to consider it."

Whenever you find yourself reacting this way, you can reasonably sure you are being victimized by "mine is better" thinking. The appropriate response is to resist the raction and force yourself to consider the matter fair-mindedly.


(什么时候可能出现“mine is better”？情感上比较愉悦，思想上基本不做思考。）

##07 Resistance to change

Any change, however, slight, represents a break in routine, threatens our established habits, chanllenges the familiar. It demands that we reconsider older responses.

（我们害怕变动，而喜欢熟悉的东西。舒适区。）

Just as we prefer patterns of acting that we know, so we prefer ideas that are not strange or foreign sounding, ideas we're comfortable with.

(有些老年人，坚决不信有人能登上月球，“那只是电视上的一个骗局罢了！”）

###insecurity and fear

Why do we resist change?Mainly because the new and unfamiliar challenge our "mine is better" thinking and threaten our sense of security. 

（拒绝改变，大概是不安全感在作祟。）

Another reason people resist change is that they're afraid of the unknown.

（害怕不确定，害怕未知。）

###Fear and tradition

"Never put a hat on a table or a coat on a bed."Thus the woman had spent her entire adult life following a rule she had been taught without once wondering about its purpose or validity.（一个女人，不问缘由，竟几十年不敢把帽子放在床上。）

###Overcoming resistance to change

It is important to overcome resistance to change.

（克服害怕改变，很重要。原因抄了。）

Here are three tips for overcoming your resistance to change:

Expect yourself to react negatively to new ideas.In addition, expect your reaction to be especially strong when the new idea challenges a belief or approach you have become attached to.

Refuse to let your initial negative(or, for that matter, positive) reaction to be the measure of the new idea. 

Force yourself to set aside that reaction long enough to appraise the idea fairly. Judge the idea on the basis of your critical appraisal and not your initial reaction. If there are good and sufficient reasons for rejecting the idea, by all means do so. 

However, be honest with yourself. If your "reasons" are only excuses in disguise, acknowledge(at least to yourself ) that you are too prejudiced to judge the idea fairly.

(原文混成了一段，自己分的段。）

##08 Conformity 

Conformity is behaving the way others around us do. In many ways conformity is desirable.

Conformity makes life less confusing for ourselves and others.

（习惯有时很有必要，但惯性会引起一些思维谬误。）

However, to conform instead of thinking and deciding is irresponsible.

（从众心理，害怕不同。因为，枪打出头鸟。）

They failed to `reconsider` those decisions.

（习惯跟随的人，他们没有重新思考自己的想法的习惯。）


（总是跟从，便丧失了独立思考的习惯。）


###Avoiding mindless conformity

Some people believe the way to avoid conformity is simply to oppose the majority view.It is not.

Other people believe the way to avoid conformity is to ignore what every one else thinks and decide on the basis of our own ideas alone.This,too, is a mistake.

Other people's vies are thus part of the evidence we must consider in forming a judgment.

The secret of avoiding mindless conformity is :



> Neither to prefer the majority or the minority view nor to be selective in the evidence we consider. It is to apply our critical thinking to all the evidence and endorse the most reasonable view regardless of who or how many endorse that view.

(不要偏爱多数或少数人的观点。不要选择性考虑证据，要看到所有证据。看看所有证据是如何支撑观点的。）

##09 Face-saving

Everyone has a self-image, and often it is a favorable one.

（每个人都会觉得，自己的观点比较好，自己的东西更好。Mine is better.）

The child who loses his temper and punches his playmate, for example, will say, "It's not my fault;she made me do it by laughing at me."

（受害者心理，不是我的错！）

Most people are quick to accept prase but slow to accept blame.

(为维护自己的完美，有时我们会无意识地去face-saving）

Similarly, people who believe they possess unusual self-control may deny that they are slaves to smoking or drinking and strain good sense in defending their habit.……"I don't drink because I have to but because I enjoy it; I can stop any time I want to."

（比如，有时我们会将”我做不到“扭曲成”我不想做“，这样心理就舒服很多了。）

(其实我们心中自己的形象，往往是扭曲的，是不正确的。我们会把自己往好的方面去想。）

###causes and effects of face-saving

There are diffent theories as to why people feel the need to save face.

One plausible theory,is that to some extent everyone suffers from feelings of inferiority.

###Controlling face-saving tendencies

Unfortunately, there is probably nothing we can do to eliminate our face-saving tendency.

It's too much a part of being human to be disposed of entirely. Nevertheless, we can learn to control it and thereby greatly reduce its effect on our critical thinking.

To control your face-saving tendency, begin by **admitting that you have it**. In addition, persuade yourself that there is no shame in having it because it is a natural tendency;there is only shame in being dishonest with yourself and denying its existence. 

Then become more aware of your reaction to unpleasant ideas that you hear or read. Try to anticipate occasions of face-saving. 

Finally, whenever you catch yourself saving face, stop and say, "OK, that's what I want to be so, but what really is so?Where does the truth lie?" By refusing to cooperate with the irrationality within you and demanding that your thinking be uncompromisingly honest rather than merely self-congratulatory, you will soon have your face-saving under control.

（承认不完美，并不可耻；可耻的是，对自己不诚实。)

（承认无知，更需要勇气。不要对自己的非理性妥协，当一个想法涌上来，试着思考，自己为什么有这个想法？理由是什么？只是因为感情上的原因吗？）

##10 Stereotyping

Stereotypes are a form of generalization. When we generalize, we group or classify people, places, or things according to the traits they have in common.

（依据共性分类。模式化，普遍化。）

The most common kinds of stereotuping are ethnic and religious.

（犹太人会赚钱，中国人爱吃，日本人条理化，德国人严谨……脸谱化，标签化。）

> 标签。

Instead of seeing that the stereotupe is false and therefore dismissing it, they reject the unfamiliar facts.

（害怕不熟悉的事物，他们习惯与简单化和模式化。）

When the prejudiced person says, "I dislike them because they are...",Martin concludes, "he really means 'Because I dislike them, they are...'"

（这种思维方式易引起偏见。）

###causes of stereotyping

Among the most significant causes of stereotyping is "mine is better" thinking, especially in its extreme form, ethnocentrism.（种族优越感）

Ethnocentrism -- the belief that one's nationality, race, or religion is superior to other people's - can be present in out-groups aswell as in the majority, and in newcomers to a country as well as in "established" groups.

Another cause of stereotyping is what Gordon Allport calls " the principle of least effort."

（我们倾向让大脑用最小的精力思考，有时便会犯简化思维的错误。）

Nor do the stereotypers themselves escape the rippling effects of their fixation.Indeed, they are often its most pathetic victims.** Stereotyping cuts them off from reality and cripples their thinking.**

（为了减少大脑活动，我们倾向于更复杂的事物贴上简单的标签，以一个特性代表整体，但是标签往往是不对的。这也算一个过度简化的毛病。）

###Avoiding stereotyping

It is not easy to set aside stereotypes that have been in your mind since childhood, particularly if they have been reinforced by ethnocentrism. Yet if you do not set them aside, you will never realize your capacity for critical thinking. Stereotypes will corrupt your boservation, listening, and reading and therefore block your understanding.

Here are two tips for freeing yourself from stereotyping. 

First, remind yourself often that people and institutions and processes seldom fit into neat categories and that critical thinking demands that you evaluate each on what it is at the particular time and place and circumstance, not one preconceived notions. 

Second, whenever you begin observing, listening, or reading, be alert for the feeling that you needn't continue because you know what the correct judgment must be. IF that feeling occurs early in the information-gathering process, you can be reasonably sure it is `a sign `of stereotyping and should be ignored.

##11 Oversimplification

Simplification is a useful, even necessary activity. The world is complex. There are thousands of subjects and millions of facts and interpretations of facts. No one can hope to be an expert in more than one or two subjects.

（世界太复杂，我们无法深入理解所有事物，因此必然寄托于简化。）

Oversimplification is an obstacle to critical thinking. It twists and distorts the idea so that it states, not truth, but error.

> Over simplification.

（过度简化，就是缺少理由，单凭想当然的价值观推出结论。）

###Causes of oversimplication

The most obvious causes ofoversimplification are simple error and unwillingness to invest the time necessary to probe the complexity of issues.（不愿花时间探寻真相，懒。）

But there are other, deeper, causes as well.

One is "mine is better" thinking, which can lead us to see issues in a biased way and thus ignore facts that don't support our view.

Another cause is insecurity. If we are intimidated by complexity, we may prefer superficial answers to questions because they make us feel comfortable. Some people need simple answers. Complex situations and those in which judgment can only be tentative and speculative leave such people disoriented.

(我们恐惧复杂的事物，因为其中不确定的东西可能带来伤害，害怕不确定，逼迫我们得到一个答案，哪怕是一个简单、简陋的答案。）


Still another cause of oversimplification is the habit of seeing only what affects us.

（短视，我们只看得到自己想看的东西。）

###Avoding oversimplification

Avoiding oversimplification simply means refusing to overstate the case for an idea. Before you express any idea to others, first check it for accuracy. If it is not completely accurate, rephrase it.

（时刻留着这个念头，你可能会犯“过度简化”的错误，以此为镜，照出谬误。）

##12 Hasty conclusions

A hasty conclusions is a premature judgement - that is, one drawn before sufficient evidence is botained.

（仓促的结论，没有充分的证据）

Hasty conclusions are not just an affliction of the uneducated. They are also found among the highly educated - even among serious scholars. The reason is that hasty conclusions are a consequence of the human condition. In other words, they are made possible by our own natrual tendencies and the peculiarities of certain normal situations.

(匆促下结论，是人类的一种天性。）

### Causes of hasty conclusions

Some people's major concern in thinking is `convenience.` They are afraid of arduous analysis and rattled by complexity.

（人类喜欢简单，而恐惧复杂。） 

Even people who have managed to get beyond convenience-thinking to greater intellectual maturity cannot escape another normal tendency - the tendency to prefer, in certain matters, one idea over all others.

（人们还有另一种天性，他们总是有偏好，总是mine is better）

So the only reasonable reaction is not to draw any conclusion at that time.

（证据不足时，唯一正确的行为就是——当时不做判断。）


Here are three suggestions that can help you avoid hasty conclusions in your thinking:(帮你避免仓促结论的一些方法）

1. Before you draw any conclusion, be sure you have identified an answered all important questions pertaining to the issue.
2. Where you can not obtain sufficient evidence, either withhold judgment or (if circumstances require an immediate judgment) use the "If...then" approach for example, if the issue concerned what punishment would be most appropriate for a murderer and you lacked some important details about the case, you might say, "if the murderer acted in the heat of anger, without any premeditation, then I believe he deserves lenienvy. However, if he visited victim with the clear intention of harming her, then I believe his punishment should be severe."
3. Where the evidence will support probability but not certainty, make your conclusion reflect that fact. That is, admit that it is impossible to say for sure what the right conclusion is, and explain why that is so. Then say what the right conclusion probably is.


##13 Unwarranted assumptions

As we saw in chapter 12, a conclusion is a judgment made after thinking (It may be carefully or hastily formed.)We reach conclusions through reasoning. 

**An assumption**, on the other hand, is an idea we have in mind without having thought about it. It is not arrived at by reasoning but merely **taken for granted**.

（假设，就是未经仔细思考的想法，自以为是的想法。）

What makes an assumption unwarranted is taking too much for granted.

###Recognizing Unwarranted assumptions

It is not too difficult to evaluate an assumption and decide whether or not it is warranted.

The real difficulty is in identifying it in the first place.

The reason for this is that, unlike the other problems in thinking we have discussed, assumptions are usually unexpressed.

（假设，总是没有被明显表述出来。）

（重要的是，时刻检视自己的假设，是否想当然了？）

##14 Logical fallacies

For an argument to be valid, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises.

（结论有效，则必须遵守逻辑关系）

- 虚假两难
- 人身攻击(解决方法——对事不对人。）
- 推卸举证责任（谁提出，谁举证）
- 因果谬误（前后关系不代表因果关系，可能相关，也可能只是巧合。）
- 稻草人（故意歪曲论点，树立稻草人攻击。）
- 不合理的诉诸
	- appeal to emotion
	- tradition or faith
	- moderation（和稀泥，因为这对双方都无害）
	- authority
	- common sense

（注意逻辑谬误）

##15 The problem is the combination

##16 Knowing yourself

Western philosophy virtually began with Socrates' advice, "Know thyself." Ever since thoughtful men and women have realized that **knowing oneself is the key to wisdom.**

（认识自己，是通往智慧的钥匙）
